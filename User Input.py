# How to take user input in python

a = input("Enter first number : ")
b = input("Enter second number : ")
print(a)
print(b)
# This will accept all type of input i.e. it will not depend on data type
# also it will not give any error in printing that too


# if we want to take input of int data type
p = int(input("Enter first number : "))
q = int(input("Enter second number : "))
c = a + b
print("Sum : ", c)
# While it will give error if we enter value other than of type 'int'
